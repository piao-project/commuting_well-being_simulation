# Commuting Well-being Simulation
## Introduction
This repository contains a collection of Python scripts designed to analyze various aspects of urban commuting patterns, costs, and impacts on well-being. 

## Scripts Overview
- **commuting_data_parsing.py**: It is used to parse and process all the commute data information that is received.
- **driving_fare_model.py**: It is used to calculate commuting costs in cities where commuting costs in driving mode are not available.
- **econnomic_indicators.py**: It is used to obtain and process economic indicators related to cities.
- **rainfall_velocity_simulation.py**: It is used to process the rainfall data during the weekday commuting period in 2022 and construct the vehicle speed attenuation model under the rainfall.
- **tengxun_map_units.py**: It is used to invoke Tencent map API to obtain location coordinates and path information.
- **wellbeing_simulation.py**: It constructs a commuting well-being loss model to simulate residents' commuting well-being loss.
